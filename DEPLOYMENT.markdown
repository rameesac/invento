## DEPLOYMENT ##

* Create a release pipeline : that automates your software delivery process using  **AWS CodePipeline**
* Connect a source repository : **GitHub** - https://github.com/rameesac/invento (master)
* Automate code deployments by connecting your pipeline to **AWS CodeDeploy**, (a service that deploys code changes committed to your source repository to Amazon EC2 instances.)
